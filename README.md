### Summary
Individual variable p-values can determine which variables provide a significant contribution to the linear mode. In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. The results show that vehicle weight, ground celarance, and AWD are statistically likely to provide non random amounts of variance to the linear model. Thus, the slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero since there are variables that are not determined by random chance or error. The linear model has an R squared of 0.7149, which means approximately 71% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model. The model's p-value is low meaning it is statistically significant. This modelis effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
